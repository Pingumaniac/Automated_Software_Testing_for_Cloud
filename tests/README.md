# About tests

This directory contains the unit tests that ensure MongoDBâ€™s functionality (CRUD operations, replica set tests, etc.) works as expected.

Thus, it contains the fuzz testing component of the project, using AFL and Atheris to perform stress tests on the MongoDB client or any other application interacting with MongoDB.
