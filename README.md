## Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the deployment and evaluation of MongoDB by:
* Automating the setup of MongoDB clusters using Docker and Kubernetes.
* Providing a suite of unit tests to validate basic functionality of MongoDB interactions.
* Integrating fuzz testing, a type of automated software testing, through American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Features
* Automated MongoDB Setup: Easily deploy a MongoDB cluster locally or on Chameleon Cloud using Docker or Kubernetes.
* FastAPI for MongoDB Interaction: A high-performance API built with FastAPI to interact with MongoDB.
* Unit Testing: Validate core MongoDB operations such as CRUD operations and replica set configurations.
* Fuzz Testing: Stress-test the MongoDB client or server with random or invalid inputs to identify crashes and vulnerabilities.
* Kubernetes StatefulSet: Deploy and manage MongoDB clusters on Kubernetes with persistent storage and replica sets.

## Tools and Technologies

1. Docker: For containerization of MongoDB.
2. Kubernetes (minikube or kubeadm): For orchestrating MongoDB clusters.
3. Python 3.12.6: For running benchmark and test scripts.
4. MongoDB CLI Tools: To interact with MongoDB from the command line.
5. American Fuzzy Lop (AFL): For fuzz testing.

## VM Distribution and Roles

This project utilizes Docker and Kubernetes across a four-VM
setup to automate the deployment, configuration, and testing of MongoDB
clusters. Each VM is designated for specific roles to maximize efficiency,
scalability, and reliability.

### VM1: Control and Orchestration Node

- **Tools**:
  - **OpenStack CLI**: Manages cloud resources on Chameleon Cloud.
  - **Kubernetes CLI** (`kubectl`): Controls Kubernetes deployments across
  VMs.

- **Role**:
  - Acts as the control point for testing environments, deploying and
  monitoring MongoDB configurations across Docker and Kubernetes.
  - Manages testing workflows, including setup and teardown, to ensure
  each service is deployed correctly and can communicate across VMs.

### VM2: Primary MongoDB Node

- **Tools**:
  - **Docker**: Hosts MongoDB in a container for isolated deployment.
  - **Kubernetes**: Operates as a Kubernetes worker node, enabling MongoDB
  to be managed in a StatefulSet configuration with persistent storage.

- **Role**:
  - Acts as the primary MongoDB instance or leader in the MongoDB
  Kubernetes StatefulSet.
  - Maintains persistent storage managed by Kubernetes for data durability
  across pod restarts or migrations.
  - Supports replication and high availability as part of a clustered
  MongoDB setup, essential for scalability and reliability testing.

### VM3: Testing and API Server

- **Tools**:
  - **Python**: Runs unit and fuzz testing scripts on MongoDB deployments.
  - **FastAPI**: Provides an API interface to interact with MongoDB for
  testing CRUD operations and replica management.

- **Role**:
  - Hosts unit and fuzz tests targeting both MongoDB
  instances in vm2 and vm4 to validate functionality, reliability, and performance.
  - Exposes an API via FastAPI, allowing CRUD operations and MongoDB
  interactions through standardized endpoints.
  - Acts as the central interface for testing MongoDB operations across
  multiple environments, supporting API-driven tests, fuzzing, and load tests.

### VM4: MongoDB Replica Node

- **Tools**:
  - **Docker**: Runs MongoDB as a containerized replica.
  - **Kubernetes**: Functions as a worker node in the Kubernetes cluster
  to provide replication and high availability in coordination with VM2.

- **Role**:
  - Acts as a replica node in the MongoDB Kubernetes StatefulSet, ensuring
  data redundancy and high availability.
  - Synchronizes data with the primary MongoDB instance on VM2, providing
  a robust environment for testing replica set configurations.
  - Contributes to the Kubernetes-managed high-availability MongoDB
  cluster, supporting failover, replication, and resiliency tests.


This VM distribution maximizes the projectâ€™s flexibility by leveraging
Docker for containerized MongoDB deployments, and Kubernetes for
high-availability and clustered management. This setup facilitates comprehensive testing of MongoDB
across different environments, ensuring reliability, scalability, and
performance.

## How to build this software

### 1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Pingumaniac/Automated_Software_Testing_for_Cloud.git
cd Automated_Software_Testing_for_Cloud
```

### 2. Set up Docker

To install Docker on Linux, run
```
sudo bash install_docker.sh
```

To retrieve the MongoDB Docker container, run
```
sudo bash install_mongodb.sh
```

### 3. Set up Kubernetes

#### a. Set up K8 with `vm1` as master and `vm2`, `vm3`, `vm4` as workers.

Next, run b-i on `vm1`.

#### b. Install Local Path Provisioner
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/v0.0.30/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml
```

#### c. Create service to connect Mongo nodes
```
kubectl apply -f mongo-service.yaml
```

#### d. Check service creation with
```
kubectl get service
```

#### e. Create 3 Mongo containers on the 3 worker VMs with Statefulset
```
kubectl apply -f mongo-statefulset.yaml
```

#### f. Check pod creation with
```
kubectl get pods
```

#### g. Enter into MongoDB instance
```
kubectl exec -it mongo-0 -- mongo
```

#### h. Create 3 replica sets
```
rs.initiate({
    "_id" : "rs0",
    "members" : [
        {
            "_id" : 0,
            "host" : "mongo-0.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local:27017",
        },
        {
            "_id" : 1,
            "host" : "mongo-1.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local:27017",
        },
        {
            "_id" : 2,
            "host" : "mongo-2.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local:27017",
        }
    ]
})
```

#### i. Ensure replica sets are initialized by running this command in the mongo shell on all VMs
```
kubectl exec -it mongo-[0|1|2] -- mongo

rs.status()
```

## How to Test this Software

### Steps for Full Setup

#### Step 1: Deploy MongoDB in Docker on VM2

**Using Docker Compose**:

Deploy a Docker container with MongoDB on VM2 using the docker-compose.yml file:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify MongoDB is accessible on localhost:27017 within VM2.

**Integration Testing for Docker MongoDB**:

Run initial tests against the Docker MongoDB instance to ensure all configurations and connections are set correctly. Use FastAPI or direct CLI commands from VM4 to interact with the MongoDB instance on VM2.

#### Step 2: Deploy MongoDB in Kubernetes on VM3

**Set Up StatefulSet and Persistent Storage**:

Apply the Kubernetes manifests from the k8s folder on VM3:
```
kubectl apply -f k8s/mongo-statefulset.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/mongo-pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/mongo-service.yaml
```

**Initialize MongoDB Replica Set**:

Log into the first MongoDB pod and initialize the replica set:
```
kubectl exec -it mongo-0 -- mongo --eval "rs.initiate()"
```

**Testing Kubernetes MongoDB Deployment**:

Use FastAPI on VM4 to interact with MongoDB in the Kubernetes setup.
Run unit and fuzz tests specifically targeting the Kubernetes-based MongoDB cluster.

#### Step 3: Testing Framework and Verification on VM4

**Run Unit Tests**:

Test basic MongoDB functionality (e.g., CRUD operations, replica configuration) for both Docker and Kubernetes MongoDB instances:
```
python -m unittest discover -s tests/
```

**Run Fuzz Tests**:

Run fuzz tests to validate MongoDB resilience under random and malformed inputs:
```
python3 tests/test_simple_fuzz.py
python3 tests/test_afl.py
```

Conduct fuzz testing on both the Docker-based MongoDB instance on VM2 and the Kubernetes-based instance on VM3.

## Final Testing and Documentation

### Monitor and Log

You can monitor logs on Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, and FastAPI to ensure
stability and identify any issues during the testing process. Use kubectl
logs for Kubernetes and docker logs for Docker MongoDB instances.

### Record Results

You can document performance metrics, any anomalies, and any differences
between the Docker and Kubernetes MongoDB instances during unit and fuzz
testing.
